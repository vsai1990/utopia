 Introduction to IPv4 Firewall
 -------------------------------
 
 The firewall is based on nftables. It uses the mangle, nat, and filters tables,
 and for each of these, it add several subtables.

 The reason for using subtables is that a subtable represents a block of rules
 which can be erased (using -F), and reconstituted using syscfg and sysevent, 
 without affecting the rest of the firewall. That makes its easier to organize
 a complex firewall into smaller functional groups. 

 The main tables, INPUT OUTPUT, and FORWARD, contain jumps to subtables that better represent
 a Utopia firewall: wan2self, lan2self, lan2wan, wan2wan. Each of these subtables
 further specifies the order of rules and jumps to further subtables. 
 
 As mentioned earlier, the firewall is nftables based. There are two ways to use nftables:
 nft -f using an input file, or issuing a series of nftables commands. Using nft -f
 disrupts netfilters connection tracking which causes established connections to appear to be invalid.
 Using nftables is slower, and it requires that Utopia firewall table structure already exists. This means
 that it cannot be used to initially structure the firewall. 

 The behavior of firewall.c is to check whether the nftables file (/tmp/.nft)
 exists. If it doesn't exist, then a new one is created and instantiated via nft -f.
 On the other hand if .nft already exists, then all subtables are flushed and reconstituted
 using nftables rules. 

 Here is a list of subtables and how each subtable is populated:
 Note that some syscfg/sysevent tuples are used to populate more than one subtable

 filter
 ------
   The filter table splits traffic into chains based on the incoming interface and the destination.
   Traffic specific chains are:
      lan2wan 
      wan2lan
      lan2self
      wan2self 
   Each chain further classifies traffic, and acts upon the traffic that fits the rule's criterea
